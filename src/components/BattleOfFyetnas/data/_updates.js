          Day one, the warriors launched a surprise attack, taking Vilkyu
          off-guard. Many hits were dealt, including one highly effective blow
          in which sorcerers Garrett and Lilly combined their powers and
          obliterated his active spell working to convince the warriors that no
          one cares.

          The battle re-commenced with experienced gladiator Simon summoning
          hoards of small but strong mercenaries to attack with full force.
          Vilkyu, noticing his strength eroding quickly, decided to get more
          clever.

          the main communication channel and created the illusion that certain
          powerful hits were not happening.

          Though effective for a while, it was only temporary. The bug was slain
          by Sorcerer Josh using a simple death spell. Then a protection spell
          evoked through a sequence of numbers and letters was put in place to
          prohibit more from returning.

          Day three kicked off with the Honorable Knight Scriven leading the
          way. Tactical by nature, Scriven devised a plan to create a diversion
          to gain visibility into the realm of Fyetna&#347; and determine
          Vilkyu's next move.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joined by the sheer strength of gladiators Caleb, Isaac and Simon they
          created quite a stir as axes banged, swords clanged and horse hooves
          kicked up dust. Vilkyu's active lie-spell against happiness was
          clearly not going to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          While chaos ensued, sorcerer Riah cloaked one of Natalie's trained
          hawks in invisibility, and James opened a portal into the realm of
          Fyetna&#347;. The hawk was able to enter and return to Natalie with
          valuable information.

          It appears that Vilkyu, now desperate, is taking to the skies and
          churning the atmosphere. He plans on conjuring a layer of snow over
          the area to isolate and hinder the warriors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Natalie schemed up the idea for a training area{" "}
          <strong>(see above)</strong> so the warriors can share ideas and
          helpful tips to stay active in this time.

          <strong>WE DEFEATED VILKYU!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The battle raged until the very end. Gladiator Caleb valiantly lead
          the charge early in the morning, followed up with a total manhandling
          from gladiators Alex and Clay. The pummeling continued until all of
          Vilkyu's forces were defeated and it was thought that he was no more.
        </p>
        <p>But an ember still burned inside him that left his spirit intact.</p>
        <p>
          At night, injured sorcerer Nathan was walking the battlefield alone.
          Noticing a stir in his soul and hearing faint whispers repeating
          "You'll always be alone", he took the axe he borrowed from the
          gladiators and enriched it with a spell of illumination. It lit up,
          and became sharp enough to divide spirit from soul. The lingering
          evil, unable to take the light, attacked. And Nathan dealt the final
          blow that sent the last of Vilkyu into obscurity. A come-back for the
          history books!
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, a spectacular effort from every warrior. Vilkyu was
          defeated much earlier than was considered possible!

          Day 6, the tiny white flakes began to trickle from the dark clouds.
          What was intended as a strategic battle move by the evil forces of
          Vilkyu, now feels like a beautiful token of victory.

          The warriors danced and sang with joy as the white robe blanketed the

          laughter and joy.

          As the warriors and their villages rejoiced in the pure white snow,
          playing and enjoying it's novelty, Muldur schemed in the background.

        <p>
          He poured over the faults of his predecessor Vilkyu, looking for a leg
          up on the warriors. Then plotted how to attack them in their unguarded
          state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always one to strike first, he seized the opportunity and is now
          whispering into their ears lies telling them they will never reach the
          level of fitness they desire.

          To complement his psychological attack against the warriors hope,
          Muldur fashioned a spell to wield the elements and build on the work
          of his predecessor. And out of the mountain emerged a rare ice dragon

          In the midst of the Golesh's presence, trees and shrubbery bent low as
          moisture froze across their limbs. And the roads hardened over and
          became nearly frictionless.
        </p>
        <p>But that wasn't the end.</p>

          Brave Archer Ben, Great Gladiator Nathan, and Skilled Sorcerers Josh
          and James, recognizing an opportunity to drive the flag of hope deep
          into the ground, ventured out into the wilderness. Their delight,
          stripped the attack of it's power. Leaving Muldur extremely vulnerable
          to more blows from other eager warriors, and driving the Golesh back
          toward the mountain. And hope for thawing returned.

          The day closed, proving to the warriors and others that they CAN reach

          shame thusfar.
