          Day one, the warriors launched a surprise attack, taking Vilkyu
          off-guard. Many hits were dealt, including one highly effective blow
          in which sorcerers Garrett and Lilly combined their powers and
          obliterated his active spell working to convince the warriors that no
          one cares.

          The battle re-commenced with experienced gladiator Simon summoning
          hoards of small but strong mercenaries to attack with full force.

          Though effective for a while, it was only temporary. The bug was slain
          by Sorcerer Josh using a simple death spell. Then a protection spell

          Day three kicked off with the Honorable Knight Scriven leading the
          way. Tactical by nature, Scriven devised a plan to create a diversion
          to gain visibility into the realm of Fyetna&#347; and determine
          Vilkyu's next move.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joined by the sheer strength of gladiators Caleb, Isaac and Simon they
          created quite a stir as axes banged, swords clanged and horse hooves
          kicked up dust. Vilkyu's active lie-spell against happiness was
          clearly not going to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          While chaos ensued, sorcerer Riah cloaked one of Natalie's trained
          hawks in invisibility, and James opened a portal into the realm of
          Fyetna&#347;. The hawk was able to enter and return to Natalie with
          valuable information.

          It appears that Vilkyu, now desperate, is taking to the skies and
          churning the atmosphere. He plans on conjuring a layer of snow over
          the area to isolate and hinder the warriors.

          Natalie schemed up the idea for a training area{" "}

          The battle raged until the very end. Gladiator Caleb valiantly lead
          the charge early in the morning, followed up with a total manhandling
          from gladiators Alex and Clay. The pummeling continued until all of
          Vilkyu's forces were defeated and it was thought that he was no more.

        <p>But an ember still burned inside him that left his spirit intact.</p>
        <p>
          At night, injured sorcerer Nathan was walking the battlefield alone.
          Noticing a stir in his soul and hearing faint whispers repeating
          "You'll always be alone", he took the axe he borrowed from the
          gladiators and enriched it with a spell of illumination. It lit up,
          and became sharp enough to divide spirit from soul. The lingering
          evil, unable to take the light, attacked. And Nathan dealt the final
          blow that sent the last of Vilkyu into obscurity. A come-back for the
          history books!
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, a spectacular effort from every warrior. Vilkyu was

          As the warriors and their villages rejoiced in the pure white snow,
          playing and enjoying it's novelty, Muldur schemed in the background.

          Always one to strike first, he seized the opportunity and is now

          To reinforce his psychological attack against the warriors hope,
          Muldur fashioned a spell to wield the elements and build on the work
          of his predecessor. And out of the mountain emerged a rare ice dragon

          In the presence of the G&ouml;lesh, trees and shrubbery bent low as
          moisture froze across their limbs. And the roads hardened over and
          became nearly frictionless.

          Brave Archer Ben, Great Gladiator Nathan, and Skilled Sorcerers Josh
          and James, recognizing an opportunity to drive the flag of hope deep
          into the frozen ground, ventured out into the wilderness. Their
          delight, stripped the attack of it's power. Leaving Muldur extremely
          vulnerable to more blows from other eager warriors, and driving the
          G&ouml;lesh back toward the mountain. Hope for thawing returned.

          As the villages thawed and foliage regained it's levity. The
          ramifications of a heavy freeze showed their effect. Sorcerer Josh
          examined the damage in the morning, seeing fallen tree limbs across
          carriages and homes, massive sheets of ice slide off of rooftops and
          rain down through tree canopies. It was clear Muldur had more in mind

          Yesterday, as gladiators Alex and Clay were slashing Muldur's minions
          left and right, Clay heard the dying whispers of one of the tortured
          souls speaking to it's master over the wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a language so broken and obscured by the tendrils of shame and
          evil that it needed deciphering. But he remembered a few phrases.
          Later in the day, he mentioned the words to sorcerer Josh who was able
          to decipher the corrupted language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apparently, Muldur is using himself as a decoy while Bradock (demon of
          fear), is preparing a spell to combine with Muldur's forces! If
          allowed to initiate, the combination of shame and fear could be

          With a time buffer from the fighting they had done the day before,
          Natalie and Caleb consulted wise Knight Scriven to devise a plan.

        <p>
          Ziir's forces were emerging from the realm of Fyetna&#347; into the
          mortal world through an enormous, rocky, muddy, slimy crater. And
          quickly!

          Scriven, calm and focused, called to mind years of healing work for
          men and women of all ages, and the purpose that emerged out of that
          dirt and grime. And he knew exactly what to do.

          multiplication and guidance over the air.

          earth. Within the valley, the warriors still lying asleep.

          Immediately, he started sprinting down the steep rock-face as fast as
          he could.

          Seering rocks started raining down upon the camp, and even pierced

          the tent and pulled James out, only barely awake. They stood and saw

          no time to waste, they awoke Sorcerer Josh and devised a unique spell.

          The lava was closing in too quickly to save everything in the camp,

          them stood the one horse in the camp, Knight Scriven's valiant
          warhorse. Consulting Scriven, they replicated the horses spirit and

          The chase was long and tiresome, Caleb, Ben, Riah, Nat and Lilly were
          dropping supplies left and right to stay light. All the while, the
          terrifying sound of ornuphs running straight through trees like butter
          was always on their tail.

          Sorcerer Riah got an idea and bolted far ahead of the group, using her
          years of horseback experience. After distancing herself quite a bit,
          she jumped off and initiated a spell, a rain dance like none other.
          And a flash flood roared toward her and filled a ravine, 20 feet high.

        <p>
          As the others neared, Riah yelled, "ride into the water!" And with
          enormous courage, each warrior road their stone horse into the water
          and clung to them as they walked the river bottom. The ornuphs
          followed directly into the water and froze as their lava solidified
          inside them.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-0">
          The warriors escaped the ornuph! But strangely, as they emerged from
          the water, none could find any of the others.
