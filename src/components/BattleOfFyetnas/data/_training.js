          Here's a short video where I talk about why I'm in this battle and
          what I hope to get out of being a more fit/healthier person.

          I (Josh) did the "Home" 30-day yoga journey, it was fun and
          approachable for someone that rarely get's to classes. Adrienne is
          pretty funny, that kept me engaged and made me feel comfortable.

        <p>Here's one of Adriene's videos, suggested by Huntress Natalie...</p>
