On these sorts of hikes, the incredible fungi strewn about has always left me wonderstruck. I missed some at the start of the hike, but I decided to research a few that I got pictures of. The first is called Ganodermataceae. The second is Physalacriaceae. And the third, I'm having trouble identifying as a fungus or a disease.",

Today, this translates into suburban homedwellers going to bed at night and waking up to a replica of their home next door made of sticks, rocks and mud.
