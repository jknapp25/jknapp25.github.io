    "description": "Millipede like light bug. 1.5ft long at maturity. By repeating a specific sequence of clicking sounds, the clicket will illuminate for up to an hour depending on maturity. If wrapped around a limb of a host, the clicket can survive as an indefinite source of powerful light on a very small amount of host blood. Despite modern battery and bulb technology being very good, the clicket is still unrivaled in terms of efficiency.",

    "description": "Small bird, no more than two inches tall. Swarms together to build elaborate nests extremely quickly. Thousands of years ago it developed a method for camouflaging it’s nests by replicating objects and patterns in the nests surroundings. For example, if there was lots of fallen trees in a wooded area, it may choose to build a nest out of sticks, rocks and mud that looks like a fallen tree. Today, this translates into suburban homedwellers going to bed at night and waking up to a replica of their home next door made of sticks, rocks and mud. Or if you’ve ever noticed a row of mailboxes and one mailbox without a house, that is often the artwork of the Sham.",

When it sits, it becomes a small fire which can be very useful for camp-outs, but If not tended to, the fire will grow indefinitely and destroy anything in its path. The only way to stop the fire is to ignore it, then the bird will return to its original form and walk away.",

Theoretically may never die unless it kills itself or another creature eats it. But it will continue to grow rapidly. Very delicious. Humans have continually tried to make them house pets but often fail due to the animals stupidity. It will tend to roll into the fireplace, onto a burning stove, into a hot bath, etc. they will congregate in large packs and lie like a pile of rocks, feeding off of each other’s warmth and the source of warmth they are on. Yellow snugs are extremely rare.",

During ancient war times distilled anise was often poured into the shallows of a river, and the ballon would congregate in that area. When picked up, soldiers would place the ballon on their forearm and it’s legs would latch on to the host. Creating an extremely effective battle shield.",
